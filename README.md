# DND-CampaignManager-API
An api for a Compain Manager for Dungeons and Dragons DMs

## Feature list (plan)
* One secret key gives full access
* Must be able to store/edit/lookup/search for the following types of things:
    * Monsters
    * Items
    * Locations (tree)
        * Shops
    * Factions
    * NPCs
    * PCs (basics)
    * Hooks
    * Temporary notes (for later filing)
* Links between above (playes belong to factions, live in towns, etc)
* Ability to generate quick Items/NPCs/Shops
* A quick search that searches everything

*Note: This project uses Doctrine 2 ORM, but wants to explicitly state that it's not meant to exemplify perfect conventions with Doctrine Entity implementation. The goal is merely to show that Doctrine Entities can be used with LunixREST.*
